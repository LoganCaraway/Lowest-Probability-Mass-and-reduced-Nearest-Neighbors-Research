# Lowest-Probability-Mass-and-reduced-Nearest-Neighbors-Research
Lowest Probability Mass Neighbors has been suggested as an alternative to nearest neighbors utilizing a mass-based similarity measure to try to overcome nearest neighbors issues when classes have different densities. I conducted research to see whether this same benefit can be had by using nearest neighbor methods that reduce the dataset to only contain the points needed for the decision boundary (condensed and edited nearest neighbors). This independent research was conducted the junior year of my undergraduate degree in my graduate machine learning course.
